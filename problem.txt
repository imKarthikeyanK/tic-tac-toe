Problem Statement 

Part A: Write a program that lets two players play tic-tac-toe with each other. 

Board: The program starts with the empty grid. 
Players: Player one chooses the symbol (options: X and O) she likes to play with. Player two is automatically assigned the other symbol. 
Turn: A playerâ€™s turn is completed when she chooses the right slot on the grid. On an invalid input, ask the user to re-enter the correct slot. 
The game ends when there is no more move to make or a player has scored a sequence (3 slots in a row, column or a diagonal). 
Consider this as version v1.0 for your program. 

Part B: Modify the program that allows players to play against a computer. 
The Player will always go first and the computer will play second.
